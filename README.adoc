Welcome to the source of the Zyn-Fusion user interface.
To build you'll want to use the Makefile (setupdep/builddep/make) and the
ahead-of-time qml compiler 'rebuild-fcache.rb'.
Parts of this repo may be underdocumented and keep in mind that this source
cannot (currently) be freely distributed. Parts of the source (src/ directory)
which have been released can be found at https://github.com/mruby-zest/

Enjoy,
